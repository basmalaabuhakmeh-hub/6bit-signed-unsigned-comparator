Advanced Digital project implementing a 6-bit comparator in Verilog that supports both signed (two’s complement) and unsigned comparison modes.

The system compares two inputs (A and B) and produces:
- A_greater_B
- A_equal_B
- A_smaller_B

The design includes:
- Unsigned comparator module
- Signed comparator module
- Input and output registers
- Multiplexer for mode selection
- Verification module
- Automated testbench

Developed for ENCS3310 – Advanced Digital.
